# Flippy 

## Game Description 
On a grid, a black and white player places tiles of their color on the board. The opponent's tiles between the newly placed tile and 
that player's existing tiles are flipped to become the color of the player's tiles. The game ends when the board fills up and the player 
with the most tiles of their color wins.
